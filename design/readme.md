#### Design for 5mm thick material - 

3 Cam profiles: Eccentric, Pear, Snail

4x Side Supports for frame
2x Center Support for frame

1x Handle for crank mechanism

Center holes from cam used as followers on the cam shafts.

Laser Cut template also below to fit a 12x24" bed. Creates several cam profiles and all the required materials for one scalable mechanism.

**Note: Each of the boards will receive a 1/4" deep, 5mm (material thickness) wide dado that is 1" from each end of the board on the top and bottom. This makes 4 dadoes total.**
