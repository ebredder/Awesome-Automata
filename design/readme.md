All basic design files to get started are uploaded here. A Fusion 360 model of the construction of one side is located here (.f3d) with some 2D template exports of the pieces (.dxf) along with a complete project laser cut template (.svg).

#### Design for 5mm thick material - 

3 Cam profiles: Eccentric, Pear, Snail

4x Side Supports for frame  
2x Center Support for frame

1x Handle for crank mechanism

Center holes from cam used as followers on the cam shafts.

Laser Cut template also below to fit a 12x24" bed. Creates several cam profiles and all the required materials for one scalable mechanism.

**Note 1: Each of the boards will receive a 1/4" deep, 5mm (material thickness) wide dado that is 1" from each end of the board on the top and bottom. This makes 4 dados total.**

**Note 2: The iron pipe must be filed about .1" down to receive the crank in order to properly turn all the cams**
